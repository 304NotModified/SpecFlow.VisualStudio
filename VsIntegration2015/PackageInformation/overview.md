# SpecFlow - Cucumber for .NET

**Check out our [quick introduction guide](http://www.specflow.org/getting-started/) and the documentation for the [Visual Studio 2015 integration](http://www.specflow.org/documentation/Visual-Studio-2015-Integration/).**

SpecFlow aims at bridging the communication gap between domain experts and developers by binding business readable behavior specifications and examples to the underlying implementation.

Our mission is to provide a pragmatic and frictionless approach to [Specification-By-Example](http://www.specificationbyexample.com/) for .NET projects. SpecFlow is open source and provided under a [BSD license](http://go.specflow.org/license).

SpecFlow also supports the concepts of Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD), which are often used synonymously with Specification-By-Example.
